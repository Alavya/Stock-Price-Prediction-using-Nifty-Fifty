Time Series Forecasting Modelling (Stock Price Prediction using Nifty) 
In this study, We utilized one- time series model and one- econometric model to 
analyze the NIFTY50 stock prices. For time series modeling, ARIMA was selected, 
which yielded an RMSE of 0.005718. Additionally, I explored several Machine 
learning models to predict NIFTY50 stock prices. These included KNN (RMSE: 
0.0120994), SVR (RMSE: 0.002818), OLS (RMSE: 0.002851), Random Forest 
(RMSE: 0.0024553), and Gradient Boosting (RMSE: 0.006169285128).
